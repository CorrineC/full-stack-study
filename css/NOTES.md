CSS, or _Cascading Style Sheets_ is the language used to style HTML content on a web page.

You can use the `style` attribute to place CSS directly into an HTML file. The attribute is placed in the opening tag and follows the traditional CSS format. Multiple styles can be added under one `style` tag.
