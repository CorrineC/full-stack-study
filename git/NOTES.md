# What is Version Control?

Version Control, a.k.a Source Control, is the process of tracking and implementing changes in software code. Version Control systems help software teams manage project contributions over time by keeping a database of modifications, which developers can use to track and correct mistakes without disrupting the development process.

## Benefits of Version Control

The primary benefits of every good version control system are as follows.

1. A complete change history of all files. This grants the ability to revert to previous versions of your software, which is useful in determining the root cause of more complicated bugs.
2. Traceability. An annotated history helps future developers understand what a piece of code is doing and why it was designed to work that way. It is particularly important for integrating legacy code harmoniously into newer projects.
3. Branching and merging. Branching allows developers to work concurrently on a project without encountering change collisions. Each branch can then be merged into the main branch, provided the changes made do not conflict.
